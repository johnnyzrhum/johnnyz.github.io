Here's the prompt:
```
the attached image shows (from top to bottom, left to right): top view, side, front and back of a "light cycle"

create a short video clip:
start with blue light cycle side view on a blue grid
80's synth sound plays as a sound track
the light cycle travels from left of screen toward right of screen
as it travels, it leave a blue transparent wall behind it's path slowly fades away
As it approaches 3/4 of the screen it takes a sharp 90 degree turn towards the top of the screen
At the same time, the camera pans upwards to provide a sky view of the grid
This is when you see the 90 degree turn complete
the blue light cycle continues to the top of the screen as the blue wall behind it before the turn continues to fade away
at this time a red light cycle speeds in from left of screen
it leaves a red wall that slowly fades behind it
The red light cycle crashes into the remaining wall from the blue light cycle just before blue wall fades away
the red light cycle explodes  in a red flash
the scene fades away
```
